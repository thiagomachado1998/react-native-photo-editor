# React Native Photo Editor (RNPE)
**I created this fork because I needed a way to sign photos that I later convert to pdf, and with this library I was able to modify it for this functionality, I'm using the sticker option to display the signatures, all the logic of signature capture and pdf conversion I do with other external libraries only I use this one to merge the photo with the signature**
